Repository of code for Weberling et al. 

## Description:
E5.0 entails an intermediate state for primitive endoderm(PE) to visceral endoderm (VE) differentiation: a process required for proper embryonic development. Hnf1b is essential for primitive to visceral endoderm differentiation from E4.5 to E5.5. To understand development at E5.0 and pinpoint the role Hnf1b in proper embryonic development, embryos were harvest at E5.0 and single cells from three WT embryos and 3 Hnf1b KO embryos were isolated, dissociated, and scRNA sequenced using smartseq2. For experiments on WT embryos, CD1 females were crossed with CD1 or homozygous E-Cadherin-GFP males.  Hnf1b -/+22 line was derived through IVF of oocytes of Black6 mice with EMMA strain EM:07827(B6.129P2(D2)-Hnf1btm1Sce/Orl) Sperm, that was bought from the EMMA institution in Orleans. 

## Experiment types: 
RNA-seq of coding RNA from single cells, cell type comparison design, development or differentiation design, genotype design
